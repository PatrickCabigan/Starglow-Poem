I watch the quiet stars above
Each shines feels like gentle love
They glow the way your eyes ignite
Soft as dawn yet bright as night

From far away I gaze and see
The stellar pull guiding destiny
And just like them though oceans part
You pull the tides inside my heart

I turn the night into my art
Each star a spark that plays its part
I trace your smile across the night
And let my quiet wishing flight

I hope one day you’ll come to know
The reason why these feelings grow
For every star that lights the view
I find a wish that leads to you
