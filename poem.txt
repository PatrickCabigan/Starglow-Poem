Starglow Polaris that Shines also
Starglow Polaris 

I watch the quiet stars above
Each shines feels like gentle love
They shine the way your eyes ignite
Soft as dawn yet bright as night

From far away I gaze and see
The stellar pull guiding destiny
And just like them though oceans part
You pull the tides inside my heart

I turn the night into my art
Each star a spark that plays its part
I trace your smile across the night
And let my quiet wishing flight

I hope one day you’ll come to know
The reason why these feelings grow
With Polaris pointing steady and true
Every direction still leads me to you

And under every sky my heart finds you!
Your evening smile melts me too.
