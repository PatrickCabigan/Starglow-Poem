I watch the quiet stars above
Each shines feels like gentle love
They glow the way your eyes ignite
Soft as dawn yet bright as night

From far away I stand and see
The bright pull guiding destiny
And just like them though oceans part
You pull the tides inside my heart

I hope one day you’ll come to know
The reason why these feelings grow
For every star that lights the blue
I find a wish that leads to you
